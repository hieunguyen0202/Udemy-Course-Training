# Tutorials
## Linux File Editor (vi)
- `vi` - visual editor
- `i`: insert
- `ESC`: Escape any of code
- `r`: replace, (ESC->move cursor before the character which you want to replace-> Type `r`-> new charater)
- `:q!`: without saving
- `:wq!` or `shift + Z + Z`: Exit and saving
## "sed" Command
- Replace a string  in a file with a newstring
    ```
    sed 's/<oldWord>/<newWord>/g' file
   # g: replace entire the file
    sed -i 's/<oldWord>/<newWord>/g' file
    ```
- Remove the string from file
    ```
    sed 's/<removeWord>//g' file
    sed -i 's/<removeWord>//g' file
    ```
    
- Find and delete a line has this `string`
  ```
    sed '/<string>/d' test

    ```
- To replace tabs with spaces
    ```
    # Not change
    sed 's/\t/ /g' test
    # Change real
    sed -i 's/\t/ /g' test

    ```
- Show defined lines from a file
  ```
    sed -n 3,5p test
  # All from the top except 3-5 last line
      sed 3,5d test

    ```
- Enter space every line
  ```
    sed G test
    sed -i G test
    ```
- Substitute within `vi` editor
## User Account Management (useradd, groupadd, usermod, userdel, groupdel)
- File 
    - /etc/passwd
    - /etc/group
    - /etc/shadow
- Commands
    - useradd:
      ```
      // User root dá»‰rectory
      su -
      // Enter password
      useradd newNameUser
      // check ID user
      id newNameUser

     ls -ltr
     ```
  - groupdel:
     ```
     groupdel oldGroupName
     // check
     cat /etc/group
     ```
  - usermod: this command is used to modify the user
     ```
     // Assign the group for user
     usermod -G oldGroupName oldUsername
     // check
     grep oldUsername /etc/group

```
whoami
more /etc/login.defs
useradd TestUser
grep Test /etc/shadow
chage -m 5 -M 90  -W 10 -I 3 -E
```
## Switch Users and Sudo Access (su, sudo)
- `su - username`: switch from one user to another
  Example: 
  ```
  ifconfig
  // check IP and using Putty to access user
  whoami
  //Example: oldUser
  su - NewUser
  exit
  // Change root
  su -
  //Example: root
  ```
- `sudo command`: If you do not have root privileges
  Example:
  ```
  // Instead switch root to run the command that has `Permission denied`
  su -
  visudo
  // We use the `sudo command`
  sudo visudo
  ```
- `visudo`: edits the etc sudo or file which is a configiration file th at allow user to add or remove the rights to run the certain commands.
- File : `/etc/sudoers`
## Monitor Users (who, last, w, id)
- `who`: tell you how many people logged into the system
- `last`: tell you all the detail of every user that have been logged in
  ```
  last
  // The last time, the user logged in 
  last | more
  last | awk '{print $1}'
  // remove the duplicate
  last | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq
  // Other
  w
  id
  id userName
  // Help
  man who
  ```
## Talking to Users (users, wall, write)
- `users`: To see how many users logged into the system
- `wall`: is the command that is broadcast your message to everyone who is logged into the Linux System
- `write`: is dedicated to a user. It's just one user to another
- Example
  ```
  // Using Putty and login
  ifconfig | more
  users
  ```
  Another command line
  ```
  wall
  PLease logoff, this system is coming down for maintenance
  PLease press `Ctrl + D` to exit
  ```
  So, the other terminal will show the same message
  ```
  // To tell the specific user
  write <NameUser>
  Hi NameUser, please stop the logged into the system
  --Press `Ctrl + D`
  ```
## Linux Directory Service - Account Authentication
## System Utility Commands (date, uptime, hostname, uname, which, cal, bc)
  - `date`
  - `uptime`:
  - `hostname`
  - `uname` | `uname -a`
  - `which` : Tell you the location of your command that you run
    ```
    which pwd
    ls -l /usr/bin/pwd
    // To see how many command in your linux system
    ls -l | wc -l
    ```
  - `cal`: give the calendar
    ```
    // cal <month> <year>
    cal 9 1997
    cal 1996
    ```
  - `bc`: show caculator on the terminal
    ```
    bc
    using `quit` to exit
    ``` 
    ## Processes, Jobs and Scheduling
    - `Process`: when you run an application or when you start up an application, it actually generate process
    - `Thread`: Every process could have multiple threads
    - `job`: is something that is created by scheduler, like Workorder to run those application and services
    Process/ Services Commands
    - `systemctl` or `service`
      ```
      systemctl start|stop|status servicename.service
      systemctl enable|disable servicename.service
      systemctl restart|reload servicename.service
      systemctl list-units --all
      ```
      - To add a service under systemctl management
        Create a unit file in `/etc/systemd/system/servicename.service
      - To control system with systemctl
         - `systemctl poweroff`
         - `systemctl halt`
         - `systemctl reboot`
    - `ps`: to see what processes running in your linux system
      ```
      So an example would be by just running the ps command, which will show you the processes of the current shell.
      PID = the unique process ID
      TTY = terminal type that the user logged-in to
      TIME = amount of CPU in minutes and seconds that the  process has been running
      CMD = name of the command
      ```
      - `ps -e`: Shows all running processes
      - `ps aux`: Shows all runnning processes in BSD (Berkeley Systems Description) format
      - `ps -ef`: Shows all running processes in full format listing (Most common used)
      - `ps -u` <username> = Shows all processes by username
      - `ps -ef | grep <NameofProcess>`
  
    - `top`: See all your process running in your system depeding on which  process you want to see first, CPU, memory information
      ```
      Top command is used to show the Linux processes and it provides a real time view of the running system.
      This command shows the summary information of the system and the list of processes or threads which are currently managed by the Linux kernel.
      Now, when you run the top command or when it is executed, it actually goes into an interactive mode and you could run a commands within that interactive mode.
      Now, if you want to get out of that interactive mode, then you have to hit `Q` on your keyboard to get out of it.
      ```
      Example
      ```
      whoami
      pwd
      hostname
      top
      //exit
      press q
      ```
      - `PID`: Show task's unique process id
      - `USER`: Username of owner of task
      - `PR`: The PR field shows the scheduling priority of the process from the perspective of the kernel
      - `NI`: Represents a Nice Value of task. A `negative` nice implies higher priority, and `positive` nice means lower priority
      - `VIRT`: Total virtual memory used by the task
      - `RES`: Memory consumed by the process in RAm
      - `SHR`: Represents the amounts of shared memory used by a task
      - `S`: Thi sfield shows the process state in the single-letter form
      - `%CPU`: Represent the CPU usage
      - `%MEM`: Shows the memory usage of task
      - `TIME+`: CPU time, the same as `TIME`, but reflecting more graularity through hundredths of a second
      - `COMMAND LINE`:
         - `top -u <userName>`:  shows tasks/processes by user owned
         - `top then press c`: shows commands absolute path
         - `top then press k`: kill a process by PID within top session
         - `top then M and P`: To sort all Linux running processes by Memory usage
         - `Please note`: Top command refreshes the information every 3 seconds
    - `kill`: kill the process name or kills by the process id
      - Kill command is used to terminate processes manually
      - It sends a signal ultimately terminates or kills a particular process or group of processes
      - Usage: `kill [OPTION] [PID]
      - `OPTION`: Signal name or signal number/ID
      - `PID`: Process ID
      - `kill -l`: to get a list of all signal names or signal number
      - `kill [PID]`(mostly use): Kil a process with default signal
      - `kill -1 [PID]`: Restart
      - `kill -2 [PID]`: Interrupt from the keyboard just like Ctrl C 
      - `kill -9 [PID]`: Forcefully kill the process
      - `Tip`: Using `top` or `ps -ef` to list a process ID
      - Example:
        ```
            // Open new terminal and type this command
                sleep 50
            //Open other terminal
                ps -ef | grep sleep
            // kill this process, given that: 655 is PID of sleep's process
                kill -9 655
        ```
       - Other similar kill commands are:
            - `killall`: This is going to kill all the process
            - `pkill`: Pkill allows you to kill by the process name. So let's say if you do not have a process ID, then you could actually simply use pkill to kill a process by its name.
    - `crontab`: is used to schedule these application or these process or services for you in your system
      - You run certain commands almost every day, at the same time to do the same thing. So why not use the crontab?
      - Some common command:
         - `crontab -e` =  Edit the crontab
         - `crontab -l` = List the crontab entries
         - `crontab -r` = Remove the crontab
         - `crond`(little use):
         - `systemctl status crond` = To manage/check the crond service
         - ![image](https://github.com/hieunguyen0202/Udemy-Course-Training/assets/98166568/0f385eef-02a3-457d-ad25-77167786ca27)
         - Example:
           ```
           // check date
           date
           // Example
           crontab -e
           21(minutes) 16(hour) *(every day) 10(month) *(fullDay) echo "This is my first command" > first-crontab
           21 16 * 10 * echo "This is my first command" > first-crontab
           // To see content in edit crontab 
           crontab -l
           // Waiting for given time, this command `echo "This is my first command" > first-crontab` will be executed
           // To remove
           crontab -r
           ```

    - `at`: At command is like crontab, which allows you to schedule jobs. 
       - When the command is run, it will enter interactive mode, and you could get out of that mode by pressing the control D.
       - Usage:
         - `at HH:MM PM` = Schedule job
         - `atq` = List the at entries
         - `atrm <index of entries>` or `atrm #`: Remove one or all entries
         - `systemctl status atd`= To mamage the atd service
         - Example: Run this command `at 4:45PM` and hit ENTER, type `echo "This is my first" > at-entry`, finally hit `Ctrl D` to exit

Now how do we run a process without interrupting the process when we close our terminal?
![image](https://github.com/hieunguyen0202/Udemy-Course-Training/assets/98166568/5620733d-db3c-41ef-a81c-834f4df7d4bb)

"Hey CPU I have this process - 'sleep 10' and please give this process priority 5, which is not too high, which is not too low". It will get tell that to the CPU and CPU will process that according to the command of "nice".
## System Monitoring Commands (df, dmesg, iostat 1, netstat, free, top)
- `top`: it has CPU information, memory information. It tells you which process it's on, which user it's running and what command it's running. If you wanna get out of it, hit Q.
- `df`: DF gives you your disk partition information. It has this block, this is available, what percent is used. Now, the most common options that is used with `df -h`. H is easier. It's human readable. It's easy to understand. Any of the usage says 100%, then definitely you are in trouble and you need to free up your disk space and you need to find out how to free up your disk space.
- `du`: It tells you the estimated file space usage, which file is taking up all the space.
- `dmesg`: `dmeg | more` gives you the output of the system related warnings, error messages, failures or anything like that. gives you the BIOS information, what, when the system initialized, how it went to, what CPU. If there is any issues with the memory, it will report you right here, if there's a memory leak, if there's an issue with CPU that's crashed, motherboard issue, anything related to your system hardware will be listed here.
- `iostat`: how we are communicating with our system peripheral devices or system internal devices, and `iostat 1` refresh it every one second.
- `netstat -rnv`:  is the option that I mostly use if I wanted to find out my gateway information, and `netstat | more` see a lot of information. What is connected to your system, what has been disconnected, what's the process id, which process is it running, and the name of the owner of the process.
- `free`: gives you the your physical memory and your swap space which is a virtual memory utilization, just usage and free.
- `cat /proc/cpuinfo`: Every time your computer is started, it keeps all its system resources information into files. And those files are located in proc. This proc is the directory where it keeps us all system information. You'll find your CPU information right here.
- `cat /proc/meminfo`: it's storing all that messages
## System Logs Monitor (/var/log)
Systems also have to keep logs and generate logs and record everything that goes on with the system.
Log Directory = /var/log
- `boot`:
- `chronyd` = NTP which is a newer version of NTP.
- `cron`
- `maillog`
- `secure`
- `messages`: messages is one of the important logs that every system administrator uses to monitor system activities.
- `httpd`: which is also an Apache application log.
- Example:
   ```
   cd /var/log
   ls -l or ll
   ll | more
   more boot.log   or ls  -l boot.log
   // When you do more on boot.log I get a message says permission denied.
   more cron
   // whenever you schedule a job or a process through a cron tab entry, it generates some kind of activity and that activity or that record is logged into this file.
   more maillog
   // has all the information about your Send Mail daemon.has all the information about your Send Mail daemon.
   
   more secure
  // all the users that have been logged in, if they have failed logging in,\
  cat messages | wc -l
  grep -i error
  // grepped every line inside of this log file that has a message called error.
   ```
  ## System Maintenance Commands (shutdown, init, reboot, halt)
  - `shutdown`
  - `init`: Now init has a different level of bringing the system down or rebooting. It goes anywhere from zero to seven, zero for simply shut down, and six is to reboot, and three is to bring it in multi-user mode.
  - `reboot` or `init 6`: Reboot simply reboots your computer. Shuts it down, and it poweroff, and bring it back online.
  - `halt`: if there are any processes that are running that needs some time to bring down other process, halt doesn't care. It just shuts down right away.
  ## Changing System Hostname (hostnamectl)
  - `hostnamectl set-hostname newhostname`
  - `hostname` or `cat /etc/hostname`
  - Version 7 = Edit /etc/hostname
  - Version 6 = Edit /etc/sysconfig/network
  - And, right now when you type `hostname`, this is the name of our machine. Now I want to change this hostname to a different hostname because my company came up with a new standard. Now every machine has to comply with the new standard requirement. So that's why I want to change it. So in order to change a hostname, you have to first become root, using `su -`
  - And Because this shell that I'm logged into, this shell has to be restarted or the whole system has to reboot in order to read the new hostname that we created.
  - Other way to change the hostname
    ```
    su -
    vi /etc/hostname
    reboot
    ```
## Finding System Information (uname, dmidecode)
Every time you log into a Linux machine, it is very important for everyone to know which system they are logged in terms of what operating system is running or what hardware it has underneath or what's under the hood.
- `cat /etc/redhat-release`: give you the information about its operating system.  
- `uname -a`: The uname -a, which will also give you the information about operating system and some kernel information
- `dmidecode`: This command will also give you the information about processor memory, the hardware that's underneath the operating system.
  ```
  whoami
  //If root
  exit
  pwd
  ls -ltr
  cat /etc/redhat-release
  uname -a
  dmidecode | more
## Finding System Architecture (arch)
- The main difference between 32 and 64-bit is the one that I highlighted in this paragraph which says a big difference between 32-bit processor and a 64-bit processor is the number of calculation per second they can perform.
- You could run 32-bit applications on a 64-bit system. However, you cannot run 64-bit applications on a 32-bit system.
- In Linux, the command to find out whether it's a 32-bit system or 64 it's just by running a simple command
  ```
  arch
  uname -a
  ```
## Terminal Control Keys
- `Ctrl U`: erase everything you typed on the command line
- `Ctrl C`: stop or kill command line
- `Ctrl Z`: suspend a command, if you are running a process, and you're stuck in that process, CTRL-z will put the process in the background and will get you your prompt back.
- `Ctrl D`: exit from an interactive program (signals end of data)
## Terminal Commands (clear, exit, script)
- `clear`: clear your screen on the command line
- `exit` : Exit out of the shell, terminal or a user session
- `script`: Script is a very helpful command. It's a command that stores terminal activities in a log file that can be named by a user. You could run it and you could name it anything that you want. Using it like the recording tool
  Example:
  ```
  // Start recording activities in the log file
  script logfile-activity.log
  // type other command and to do anyhing else
  // To exit the recording
  exit
  // to see the result
  more logfile-activity.log
  ```
## Recover Root Password
Every system administrator in his or her life faces this issue where they have to recover root password. And why do they face that? Is because they either have to comply with security standard to change the root password. Every now and then, they change it, but then they forget after a year or two or they fat fingered while changing the root password and now they cannot recover it. So how do we change it? You have to `restart your computer`, `Edit grub`,`Change password`, `reboot`.
This is the step by step

## SOS Report
- Anyway, so SOS is something that is called when someone is in really deep trouble and needs help. So this, based on the same idea Red Hat or CentOS has created something called SOS Report. It's a command. When you run that command it actually collects all the information about your files, your logs, put it into a package and it sends it out
to them.
- The purpose of this report? Collect and package diagnostic and support data.
- Package name `sos-version`
- Command `sosreport`
